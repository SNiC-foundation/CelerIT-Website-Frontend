    "description": "When Hans and Gerrit Mulder founded ChipSoft in 1986, they were motivated by a spirit of hard work and developing the best healthcare software. Years later, this no-nonsense mentality still lies at the heart of our company. Even more than ever, because today the Mulder family works together with hundreds of 'Chippies' to improve healthcare.\n \nAll these talented and experienced employees are given the opportunity to develop themselves through educational courses and training. Furthermore, they are given the freedom to elaborate their own ideas and to organise activities with colleagues as well. Do you have a fun idea for a team outing or an event? Bring it on! Because, as hard as we work, we also laugh.\n \nWhat defines ChipSoft? To teach medical experts the intricacies of our software, as well as developing a solution that optimises patient logistics in all hospitals using HiX. But also: having lunch together and playing with the CEO's dog. All with a common goal in mind: to provide better care and to create ICT solutions that really help patients, doctors and nurses. All while working together in a great atmosphere. Would you like to join us?\n",
